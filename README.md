This project is part of course #10 of the OpenClassRooms formation iOS Developer.

It focuses on important elements:

- Using an open source library
- Managing a Table View
- Using the delegate pattern

Description of the application:

Reciplease allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients. 
You can also save your favorite recipes as favorites.
The application is divided into two parts: the search and the favorites. 
You can navigate between the two parts thanks to a tab bar.

Reciplease relies on Edamam's API which offers a search engine to find recipes. To use it, you must register on the site via the subscription page.
